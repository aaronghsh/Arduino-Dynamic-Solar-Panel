## Technologies Used

- **Arduino**: For control system programming and hardware integration.
- **C++**: To implement the servo motor control and sensor readings.
- **Servo Motors**: To dynamically adjust the orientation of the solar panel.
- **Photoresistors (LDRs)**: To detect light intensity and guide the panel's movements.
- **Autodesk Inventor**: For designing and 3D modelling the housing components, optimizing for fabrication and assembly.

## Features

- **Dynamic Sunlight Tracking**: 
  - Utilizes a servo motor to adjust the panel's angle.
  - Photoresistors measure light intensity to determine the optimal direction.
- **Energy Optimization**: Ensures the panel captures maximum sunlight by real-time adjustments.
- **Custom Housing**:
  - Designed in Autodesk Inventor to protect components.
  - Optimized for ease of assembly and manufacturing.

## Project Components

1. **Hardware**:
   - **Arduino Uno**: Acts as the brain of the system.
   - **Servo Motors**: Rotate the panel for precise sunlight tracking.
   - **Photoresistors (LDRs)**: Detect light levels from different directions.
2. **Software**:
   - The Arduino sketch reads light intensity values from the photoresistors, calculates the difference, and adjusts the servo motors accordingly.
